# Logistical Information

## Deadlines
- **04/03**: Overview of the dataset. We will go through the example notebook,
explaining in detail how the AllenSDK works.
- **19/03**: Discuss your research question, project ideas, and potential issues with
the data.
- **14/04**: Progress follow-up and problems you might encounter.
- **14/05**: Presentation of the projects to the class
- **18/05**: Deadline to submit the written report.

You are expected to propose a question to study for your project, Taking inspiration from:
1. The lessons, lecture notes, and the textbook.
2. Research papers and the literature.
3. Playing around with the data
4. Your own ideas!

## Project Description

Projects will be maximum 2 pages long, not including figures, tables and references. Please note that the goal is to come up with a good scientific question and to use an adequate methodology to answer it. It is not essential to positively answer your research question, but rather to present an insightful discussion your results, being either positive or negative.

As a rule of thumb, both your presentation and report should have a structure resembling this one:
1. Introduction
- Explain the significance and interest of your research topic.
- Provide context by relating your work to topics covered in the course.
1. State your research questions
2. Methodology
- Detail the methodology, analysis, pipeline, or model used in your project.
- Provide a clear and concise overview of the steps taken in your research.
- Include any relevant technical details.
1. Results
- Present your findings in a structured manner.
- Utilize plots and visuals to enhance clarity.
- Highlight key trends, patterns, or insights from the results.
1. Discussion
- Address whether your research questions were successfully answered.
- Explain the rationale behind your findings and discuss their implications.
- Reflect on what alternative approaches could have been taken.
- Acknowledge and discuss the limitations of your chosen methodology.
- Suggest potential areas for future research based on your findings

## Evaluation, .../16 points

- Quality of the technical analysis. (7 points). How well is the analysis executed? Are appropriate methods and techniques applied to the given research questions?
- Discussion of results and limitations. (5 points) How thoroughly are the results discussed in relation to the research questions? Is there a thoughtful
exploration of the limitations of the approach?
- Clarity of presentation (2 points for report + 2 oral presentation). Is the information communicated clearly and understandably?

You also must submit all code used to perform the analysis.
