# Question

How to unit activations vary between visual and non-visual cortices in mice brain, comparing static and drifting gratings?

# Abstract



# Introduction
The introduction should provide background information on the topic, including relevant literature and the objectives of the study. 

# Focus of study

We compare the effect of different stimuli: `static gratings` and `drifting gratings` on different parts of the brain. We compare the effect on the visual cortex and on one non-visual cortex.

In terms of areas of the brain, we have:
- VISp which is the primary visual cortex 
- Higher Visual Areas (HVA)
- VISI (lateral visual area)
- VISal (anterolateral visual area)
- VISpm (postermodedial VA)
- VISam (anteromedial VA)
- CA1 - non-visual
